# vigenere-cipher-python
This small repo consists of python code for encoding and decoding a message according to the vigenere cipher decryption method. 
It was written in November 2020, when I was a beginner trying to learn Python 3.
I wrote it without looking anything up, so the code is definitely not optimal, and has not been tested extensively whatsoever so it may contain bugs.
